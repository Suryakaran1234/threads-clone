## <a name="introduction">🤖 Introduction</a>

Introducing our latest project, made by our team called TrioTrek. I'm Surya Karan Sharma, leading the team, along with Nish Kamli and Gurtek Singh as our teammates. We worked on this for our final semester in the Web Programming and Framework II Course as a group project.

What did we do? We built a clone of Threads using Next.js 14+. It's a website that looks and works like Threads, but with our own twist.

What's cool about it? Well, we added some neat stuff. You can reply to comments within comments, get notified about new activity, and search for stuff in real-time. There's more to explore, too. Dive in and see what we've created!
